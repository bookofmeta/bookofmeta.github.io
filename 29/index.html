        <p>Behavioral communication is better than direct communication for persuasion. People believe behavioral communication more than direct communication. They expect others to lie in direct communication but trust behavioral communication. For example, people will not believe a person when he says he is strong, but will get it when he behaves fearlessly. People react differently to direct and behavioral communication because they listen to them differently. They use reason to listen to direct communication but use emotions to listen to behavioral communication. They believe behavioral communication because they can’t deny the emotions they feel. For example, a person cannot question the strength of an opponent when he feels the fear. The authentic nature of behavioral communication makes it a useful tool for solving relationship conflicts. Most conflicts in relationships arise due to emotional issues. They cannot be solved through dialogue as it won’t fix the underlying emotional issue. But behavioral communication will work as it can fix the underlying emotion issue. For example, a son might bicker with his father for trivial problems because he resents his father’s weakness. The father cannot stop the bickering by pointing out the trivial nature of problems. He can stop it by displaying strength in his behavior by not reacting to his son’s bickering.</p>
