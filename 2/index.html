        <p>Science has become the major source of knowledge in the modern world. But it has limitations when studying human emotions. Human consciousness prevents scientists from getting empirical data on human emotions. They can gather data from the body but cannot directly observe emotions. The best they can do is ask a subject about their emotions. Data gathered by questioning is not empirical as there is no way to verify it. The lack of empirical data will always limit scientific understanding of human emotions. But other sources of knowledge like religion and wisdom don’t have this limitation. Wisdom is knowledge which is gained by a person through experience and reason. Everyone has innate ability for wisdom. Wisdom will help you understand your emotions. You will realise that your seemingly irrational emotions have reason behind them. You will realise that you have incredible ability to shape your emotions. Wisdom will help you understand emotions of others. You can observe how people behave to understand their emotions. You will realise that seemingly irrational behaviour of people have reason behind them. You will realise that you have incredible ability to shape emotions of others. Don’t shy away from wisdom because you are learning it yourself. Don’t doubt it if others don’t subscribe to it. All that matters is its usefulness for you. Wisdom will help you solve all of your problems as they are all emotional in nature.</p>
