        <h2 id="what-is-leadership">What is leadership?<br /></h2>
<p>Leadership is a human relationship where people willingly submit to someone they trust. They give up part of their autonomy to the leader.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-leadership">What is the purpose of leadership?<br /></h2>
<p>Most people are not mentally strong enough to handle uncertainties of life. The uncertainty of happiness and suffering makes them feel insecure. They insecure makes them doubt their ability to safeguard themselves from unforeseen misfortunes. So they look for external methods to safeguard themselves. Accepting a mentally strong person as a leader is such a method to safeguard themselves. A mentally strong person is unperturbed by uncertainties in life. It makes them brave. They don’t fear unforced misfortunes. When an insecure person accepts a leader they submit to the leader. They give up part of their autonomy to their leader. They give the leader the responsibility for safeguarding them. They feel safe after doing it because they are certain in the leader’s ability to tackle unforeseen misfortunes. So the purpose of leadership is to make weak people feel safe. For example, children feel safe under the leadership of parents. Citizens feel safe under the leadership of the government.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-mental-strength">What is mental strength<br /></h2>
<p>Mental strength is the ability to handle the uncertainties of life. Happiness and suffering are never completely under a person’s control. This uncertainty creates an insecurity in people as they are wary of an uncertain future. The insecurity makes them overwhelmed by adversity. This insecurity cannot be removed through intellectual knowledge as the underlying uncertainty is caused by factors outside the control of an individual. This why people from all walks of life experience this insecurity including well educated people, scientists and financially successful people. The only way to handle this insecurity is through mental strength. Mental strength is an ability to be calm under uncertainty. Mentally strong people are comfortable with uncertainty. They are not overwhelmed by adversity.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-characteristics-of-a-leader">What are the characteristics of a leader<br /></h2>
<p>Leaders are mentally strong. All of their attributes are derived from their mental strength. They are brave. They are kind. They are brave as they don’t get overwhelmed by fear. Their mental strength makes them kind. Selfish people are not kind because they are insecure. They can’t care for others as they are preoccupied with their own security. Since mentally strong people don’t have this insecurity they are kind. Mentally strong people are not overly attached to anything. They don’t even care if they lose their followers. The readiness to lose anything makes them immune to all kinds of manipulation.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-leaders-made">How are leaders made?<br /></h2>
<p>Leaders are made by followers. Insecure people are always subconsciously looking for a leader. When they meet a person who is mentally stronger than them, they submit. They perceive the strength of a leader from the leader’s behaviour They see strength when the leader remains calm under pressure. They see strength when the leader is immune to manipulation from followers.
Before submitting to a leader they need to trust the leader. They perceive the trust worthiness of a leader from the leader’s behaviour. If the leader shows selfless behaviour they are trust worthy. 
Once they see a leader as strong and trust worthy, they submit. After submitting they see the leader as a stronger extension of themselves.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-leaders-handle-their-followers">How do leaders handle their followers<br /></h2>
<p>Leaders care for their followers. But they don’t depend on them for their own well being. Leaders don’t receive anything in return for their leadership. They don’t even expect anything in return. They don’t even care if they lose their followers. This enables them to resist any manipulation from their followers. It also enables them to take unpopular decisions for their followers. Their empathy for followers gives them clarity in making decisions for followers. Some decisions may be unpopular and followers if they don’t understand the leader’s perspective. But their trust for the leader helps followers accept the unpopular decisions. Leaders don’t see anyone as enemies as they are not overly attached to anything. This is why they are able to negotiate with enemy of his followers. They rise above the petty differences between their followers and the enemy. Their empathy for the enemy enables him to see the enemy point of view. Because of this they are able to negotiate with the enemy. Their empathy for followers and the enemy makes then negotiate a fair compromise to resolve the conflict. So they are able to prevent conflicts with negotiation. They do it with the wisdom that conflict is not good for their followers or the enemy. But they are always ready for conflict, that is how they ensure fairness during a negotiation.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-leadership-affect-followers">How does leadership affect followers<br /></h2>
<p>Them mental strength of followers increase after they submit to a leader. It helps them handle adversities which they would otherwise be too scared to do. They become disciplined as their mental strength allows them to control themselves. They become honorable as their mental strength allows them to be kind with others. They also become loyal to the leader. They will be ready to fight battles for the leader.</p>

<h2 id="weak-leaders">Weak leaders<br /></h2>
<p>A leader doesn’t have to be the mentally strongest person ever. He just has to be stronger than his followers. This is why throughout history there are leaders of varying strength. But the strongest leaders have influence over their followers even after their death. Weak leaders perpetuate more weak leaders. This is because they redefine the bar of leadership to their followers.</p>

<h2 id="leadership-institutions">Leadership institutions<br /></h2>

<p>All cultures across the world created institutions which provide leadership to people. Since people need to feel safe from a wide range of unforeseen circumstances different institutions were created with different types of leadership.<br /></p>

<p><strong>Government</strong><br />
The main purpose of government is leadership. It exists to make feel people secure from aggression of domestic and foreign actors.</p>

<p><strong>Religion</strong><br />
Religion makes people feel safe. It makes them feel secure about death and all unforeseen misfortunes. It provides much more strength than government as people can’t trust government completely as it could be hijacked by selfish people. But god is always strong and kind to religious people.</p>

<p><strong>Family</strong><br />
Family is the lowest unit of leadership in society. A leader of a family makes his family feel safe. He safeguards the family in situations where religion or government can’t. For example the leader of the family will provide financial security by providing for the family. He will also provide physical security from threats from local aggression. Parents provide leadership to children.</p>
