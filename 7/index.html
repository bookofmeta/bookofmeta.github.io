        <p>Most companies are selfish. Some of these companies have no empathy for anyone including their own customers. Some companies have empathy for their customers but not their employees. Some have empathy for both their customers and employees, but not for the environment. Companies exhibit their selfishness by exploiting one or more parties with whom they trade. Companies cannot exist in isolation. They have to trade with the world to create wealth. They trade with people for being employees and customers. They trade with other companies for raw materials. They trade with government for law and order. They trade with the environment for natural resources. Selfish companies exploit trading parties by taking a bigger share of the trade. They take more but give back less. Companies can prosper by making fair trades as both parties are better off in a fair trade. But selfish companies donâ€™t have intent to do fair trades. Even if they are fair with one party they exploit another. The net effect of selfish companies is exploitation of the world.</p>
