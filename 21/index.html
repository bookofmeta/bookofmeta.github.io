        <p>Compassion is not healthy when it comes out of <a href="/18/">selfishness</a>. When you let your child manipulate you, you do it out of selfishness. You might tell yourself that you do it out of compassion but in reality you are selfish. Resisting a child’s manipulation is essential in <a href="/5/">parenting</a> as it builds strength in a child. By refusing to be strong enough to resist your child’s manipulation you are prioritising your own well being over your child’s. Similarly, when you give money to charity to feel good, you do it out of selfishness. You do it because you are addicted to the good feeling of doing charity. Selfish compassion comes from <a href="/17/">weakness</a>. You are never compassionate without a payoff. You are never compassionate if it brings you trouble. Genuine compassion comes from strength. It is selfless compassion. You express it without any payoff. You express it even when it brings you trouble. You don’t look for appreciation. You have compassion for everyone including those who were selfish towards you. Your compassion gives strength to people. You are compassionate because you have surplus strength.</p>
