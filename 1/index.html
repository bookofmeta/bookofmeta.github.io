        <p>Knowledge is not always useful. It is useful only when it brings about a change in your life. Otherwise it is entertainment. Useful knowledge brings change into your life by changing your behavior. It achieves this by permanently changing your view of the world through logic. When a seasoned public speaker learns a new technique in public speaking it is useful knowledge as they can use it in their next speaking assignment. The same knowledge is useless for a person who has an aversion for public speaking. Emotions can stop you from using knowledge even if you understand its utility. Emotional behavior cannot be changed through logic. To change emotional behavior, you need insight. Insight works by changing your view of the world at a subconscious level. A person will overcome their fear of a scary monster when they see that it is actually a friend in a mask. To get useful knowledge, seek it from people who earned it through insight. But it will not bring insight for you. Insight comes only from personal experience. To gain insight, you have to overcome your emotions and venture to unchartered territories to see the world for yourself.</p>
