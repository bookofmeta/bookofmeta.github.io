        <p>Knowledge is not always useful. It is useful only when it brings change in your life. Otherwise it is entertainment. Useful knowledge brings change in your life by changing your behavior. It achieves this by permanently changing your view of the world through logic. When a seasoned public speaker learns about a new technique in public speaking it is useful knowledge as they can use it in their next speaking assignment. The same knowledge is useless for a person who has aversion for public speaking. Emotions can stop you from using knowledge even if you understand their utility. Emotional behavior cannot be changed through logic. To change it you need insight. Insight works by changing your view of the world at a subconscious level. A person will lose fear for a scary monster when he sees that it is actually his friend in a mask. To get useful knowledge seek it from people who got it through insight. But it will not bring insight for you. Insight comes only from personal experience. To get it you have to overcome your emotions and venture to unchartered territories to see the world for yourself.</p>
