        <h2 id="what-is-approval-seeking-">What is approval seeking? <br /></h2>
<p>Approval seeking is a behaviour which helps you respect yourself. In this behaviour, you try to make others respect you. When others respect you, you respect yourself. For example, you will try to impress someone so that they respect you. When they respect you, you respect yourself. This behaviour is driven by the lack of self-respect. Self-respect is your respect for yourself. It is natural for you to need to respect yourself as it gives you confidence in your fitness as a human being. Without self-respect you will feel like you are dying. You are not born with self-respect. But you are born with a need for it. From a young age, you look for ways to respect yourself. You try respecting yourself unconditionally but it doesn’t work as you don’t trust your judgement. You realize that you trust the judgement of others. So you try to use others’ judgement to respect yourself. It works. You are able to respect yourself when others respect you. But others’ respect only improves your self-respect temporarily. So you need more and more of others’ respect to maintain your self-respect. Thus approval seeking becomes a never-ending project. Your need for respect becomes so strong that it becomes a major driver of your behaviour when you reach adulthood. Approval seeking becomes the ultimate objective underlying of most of your objectives in life.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-approval-seeking-not-good-for-you">Why is approval seeking not good for you?<br /></h2>
<p>When you seek approval from others you become proficient in getting respect from others, but still always have low self-respect. This is because respect from others only increases your self-respect temporarily. It won’t even last a day. It is easy for you to doubt any respect you get from others. For example, you got a compliment from your boss, you will doubt it by thinking that he gave you a compliment for just being nice. So respect from others is never enough. You seek more and more. But still, you always have low self-respect. So you will waste a tremendous amount of energy in trying to achieve an impossible goal.<br /><br />
Approval seeking puts your self-respect at the mercy of others. Since self-respect is very important for you, putting it at the mercy for others is not good for you. You can’t control others. So you can’t control their respect for you. So the outcome of approval seeking is always uncertain. <br /><br />
People also have a motivation to not give you respect. Since they themselves have a low self-respect, they try to refrain giving respect to others. They think that they will lose their own self-respect by giving respect to others. So it is tough to get respect from others.<br />
Thus seeking approval is futile, uncertain and hard.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-stop-seeking-approval">How to stop seeking approval<br /></h2>
<p>The first step in stopping approval seeking behaviour is understanding that your self-respect should be intrinsic. You should respect yourself unconditionally. Understand that there is no objective standard to respect yourself or anyone else. Any standard for respect is man-made and artificial. So you don’t have to attach importance to the standards of respect which society approves. Everyone including yourself deserves equal respect for just being a person.<br /><br />
Understanding that everyone deserves equal respect will not stop your approval seeking behaviour. It will continue because of habit. It will be a difficult task to stop it. To stop it you need awareness, grit and forgiveness. Use your awareness to identify your approval seeking behaviour. Then use your grit to stop yourself from doing it. It will be difficult and seem risky. No amount of thinking will help you. You just have to use your courage to do it. You will fail often. Forgive yourself for failing and then try again. Never disrespect yourself for failing. It will completely sabotage this endeavour. Keep trying until you are able to easily stop your approval seeking behaviour. It will be a life-long endeavour as there will always be moments where you will be tempted to seek approval. Always be aware and stop yourself.</p>
