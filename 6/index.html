        <p>One of the largest psychological problem of modern people is their need for validation. They constantly seek validation of their worth as a human being. They follow societal norms for validation. They constantly seek to feel better than others. Unfortunately, it is not easy to get validation as everyone is seeking it. Even if they get it, it only gives them momentary satisfaction. This makes them anxious as they are never sure about their worth. They feel like they are dying when they don’t get validation. All human beings have an innate insecurity about their worth due to fragility of life. No amount of reason or ingenuity can remove this insecurity as death is inevitable. One way to remove the insecurity is to build mental strength. But most people are not able to be mentally strong. The only way for them to remove the insecurity is to give-up their individual autonomy. If they don’t feel responsible for their life, they will not worry about it. They could give up their autonomy by submitting to a god, leader or group. Submitting to a god allows them to feel safe under the care of god. Submitting to a leader allows to them to receive the strength of the leader. Submitting to a group allows them feel safe in collective strength. Unfortunately, modern society has glorified individual autonomy. Left with no other option, modern people handle their insecurity by looking for external validation of their worth.</p>
