        <p>Submission has a bad reputation in the modern world. People think that it is not wise to submit to another person. Submission entails following a personal leader. People dislike submission as it requires giving up liberty. But the leader-follower relationship is an important human dynamic. It solves a basic human need. It provides strength to the weak. Most people are <a href="/17/">mentally weak</a>. Liberty is a burden for them. They feel insecure when they are responsible for themselves as they don’t have confidence in their ability to manage uncertainties of life. They feel secure when they transfer their responsibility to a stronger person they trust. Following a leader allows them to do this. It gives them strength. Leaders are <a href="/17/">mentally strong</a>. They have a surplus of strength which allows them to take responsibility of themselves and others. Their selfless nature allows followers to trust them. A parent has surplus strength to selflessly take care of their child. A family head has surplus strength to selflessly take care of their family. Submitting to a strong leader makes a person strong whereas submitting to a week leader makes a person weak. Strong leaders are selfless, weak leaders are selfish. The strength of a leader should be constantly checked to make sure they are strong.</p>
