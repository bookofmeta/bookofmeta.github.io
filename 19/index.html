        <p>Submission has a bad reputation in modern world. People think that it is not wise to submit to another person. Submission entails following a personal leader. People dislike It as it requires giving up of liberty. But the leader-follower relationship is an important human dynamic. It solves a basic human need. It provides strength to the weak. Most people are <a href="/17/">mentally weak</a>. Liberty is a burden for them. They feel insecure when they are responsible for themselves as they donâ€™t have confidence in their ability to manage uncertainties of life. They feel secure when they offload their responsibility to a stronger person they trust. Following a leader allows them to do this. It gives them strength. Leaders are mentally strong. They have a surplus of strength which allows them to take responsibility of themselves and others. Their selfless nature allows followers to trust them. A parent has surplus of strength to selflessly take care of their child. A family head has surplus of strength to selflessly take care of their family. While submitting to a strong leader will make a person strong, submitting to a weak leader will make them weak. While a strong leader is selfless, a weak leader is selfish. The selfishness of a leader should be constantly checked to make sure they are strong.</p>
