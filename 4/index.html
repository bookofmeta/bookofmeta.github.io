        <p>Leaders exist because people are weak to fight big battles in life themselves. Leaders provide strength to people. They are strong enough to be brave and kind. They are brave enough to fight big battles for their followers. They are kind enough to have selfless empathy for followers. A leader’s bravery and empathy makes followers see a stronger extension of themselves in the leader. Followers submit to receive their leader’s strength. Submission makes them feel stronger. It builds bond of trust and loyalty. They cede their autonomy to the leader as they trust their leader’s decisions. Empathy gives leaders clarity in taking decisions for their followers. They are not afraid to take unpopular decisions as their intentions are good. Leaders only give. They don’t depend on their followers for their own well-being. They are resistant to manipulation by followers as they don’t care if they lose their leadership. They respect the enemy. They understand that all people deserve respect. They try to prevent conflict as they understand that conflict only brings misery.</p>
