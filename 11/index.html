        <p>It is not always wise to compete. It is wise to compete for survival. If someone tries to harm you, you should fight back. But it is not wise to compete to show superiority. If someone insults you, you don’t have to fight back. You lose a higher battle with your opponent the moment you compete to show superiority. You show weakness. Your need to show superiority will communicate a need for validation of your self-worth from your opponent. Your opponent will feel strong by your need for their validation. Even if you win the competition they will not stop challenging you as you make them feel strong. In contrast if you show indifference for competitions to show superiority you win a higher battle with your opponent. You show strength. You communicate indifference for your opponent’s validation. Your opponent will feel weak by your indifference. They will stop challenging you. When you compete to show superiority you lose a higher battle with yourself. You put your self-worth at the mercy of others. You make yourself weak.</p>
