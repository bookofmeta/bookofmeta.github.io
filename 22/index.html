        <p>Negotiation is the process by which you resolve a dispute with an opponent through give and take. <a href="/18/">Selfish</a> opponents will try to manipulate the negotiation in their favour. They will try to give less and take more. They will be successful if they have leverage in the negotiation. The most important leverage in any negotiation is the ability to walk away from it. When you walk away you don’t give or take anything from the negotiation. You can walk away if you can do without receiving anything from the negotiation. When you can walk away, your opponent can’t force you to take a bad deal, but you can force them to take a bad deal if they need something from you. For instance if you can’t quit your job you wont be able to walk away from pay negotiations with your employer. Your employer can refuse to increase your pay and get away with it as you are unable to quit. When you can walk away from a negotiation you can ask for a favourable deal and walk away if you don’t get it. It is a good strategy as it nullifies impact of negotiations on you. It is better to abstain from negotiations than go into them with a chance of losing. To be able to walk away from any negotiation you need confidence to overcome losing any negotiation. That confidence comes from <a href="/17/">mental strength</a>.</p>
