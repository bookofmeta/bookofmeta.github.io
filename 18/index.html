        <p>People are not selfish out of malice. They are selfish because they are <a href="/17/">mentally weak</a>. Mental weakness is the inability to control emotions. When a person is mental weak they let emotions overpower them. They take ups and downs of life personally and become insecure. Their insecurity makes them chronically seek security. They see other people as tools to handle your insecurity. This makes them selfish. They don’t empathize with suffering of others as they are preoccupied with their own insecurity. They envy happiness of others as they are anxious about losing their happiness. They enjoy misfortunes of others as they are happy to not have faced the same misfortune themselves. They <a href="/16/">rationalize</a> their selfish behavior as they can’t handle emotion of being at fault. They have no sense of morality or justice as emotions affect their rationality. They can’t see another person’s perspective as their insecurity never lets them give-up their perspective. They don’t give out respect or appreciation to others as they crave it themselves. They like to put down others as it makes them feel superior.</p>
