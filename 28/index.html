        <p>Mental strength is the ability to control emotions. Emotions like fear, sadness and happiness influence your behavior. They make you behave irrationally. Mental strength helps you behave rationally even under the influence of emotions. But it is difficult to build mental strength. The first step in building mental strength is to understand its utility. You need to look into your life and understand how past irrational behavior harmed you. The second step is using willpower to stay rational when under the influence of emotions. This will be hard as emotions overwhelm you. But when you succeed, you will see the benefits of controlling emotions. It will keep you motivated. The last step is meditation. Meditation builds mental strength as a reflex ability. The normal reflex action of the mind is to react to emotions. Meditation alters this reflex action. It trains the mind to not react to emotions. You will no longer get overwhelmed by emotions. You will do it without conscious thought.</p>
