        <h2 id="what-is-knowledge">What is knowledge?<br /></h2>
<p>Knowledge is understanding about the self and world.</p>

<h2 id="is-all-knowledge-useful">Is all knowledge useful?<br /></h2>
<p>Knowledge is not always useful. Most people don’t think about usefulness of knowledge they acquire. They learn about new things because modern society has gloried knowledge. This leads to them people hoarding knowledge which is of no use. For example, people study about how to start a business in college but never use that knowledge to start a business.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-knowledge-useful">When is knowledge useful?<br /></h2>
<p>Knowledge is useful when it helps in day to day life. For example, people learn about negotiations in college and use that knowledge when negotiating in day to day life. So knowledge on negotiations is useful to such a person.</p>

<h2 id="why-care-about-usefulness-of-knowledge">Why care about usefulness of knowledge?<br /></h2>
<p>Knowledge which is not useful is not harmful. But it does give problems. If you seek knowledge with an objective then useless knowledge can take you away from the objective. For example, you will could lost in learning everything about starting a business before actually doing it. The vast amount of knowledge available in this topic will give you an illusion that it is possible to remove all uncertainties with knowledge. Unfortunately knowledge cannot cure uncertainty as it is an emotional condition. It comes from the fear of the unknown. Knowledge cannot remove this fear as there will always be something unknown. You have to accept the risk and go ahead. But if you think knowledge can help you feel safe then you will keep on postponing starting the business until you have all knowledge. The knowledge you gathered in the process is useless as it doesn’t help you in your objective. It is also harmful to you as it takes you away from starting your business.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-seeking-knowledge-without-an-objective">What about seeking knowledge without an objective?<br /></h2>
<p>Seeking knowledge for the sake of knowledge is not harmful. It can be seen as entertainment. But you should be careful to not bring this habit when seeking knowledge for an objective. For example, if a job requires you to do a task in a new field it is a mistake to want to learn everything about the field before proceeding to the task. This mistake comes from seeking knowledge for entertainment. The right approach will be to learn only the required knowledge to do the task.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-seeking-knowledge-for-inspiration">What about seeking knowledge for inspiration?<br /></h2>
<p>Seeking knowledge for inspiration is not harmful as long as it doesn’t spill over to your other activities. Don’t look for inspiration when doing a trivial task, just acquire the required knowledge. Look for inspiration to start a big project. It will help you carry yourself to complete it.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-stop-learning-useless-knowledge">How to stop learning useless knowledge?<br /></h2>
<p>Seek knowledge only on a need basis. For example, when starting a business acquire only the minimum knowledge required to start a business. Do not seek knowledge on marketing as it will be only be useful much later. This doesn’t mean you should not plan ahead. Plan ahead, but be aware of your reasons when seeking knowledge. When you see yourself seeking knowledge for entertainment or for avoiding fear, stop yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t value knowledge based on how it sounds</strong><br />
When you are exposed to new knowledge, you don’t immediately evaluate if it useful for you. Instead you evaluate it based on how it sounds. You might find it impressive just by the way it sounds. For example, a movie can teach about the importance of kindness in a person’s happiness. It will use beautiful images and music to covey this knowledge. People watching it will think the knowledge useful because it looks and sounds impressive. But this knowledge doesn’t help them practice kindness in their lives. So the knowledge is not useful. But people think it is useful. They end up wasting their time. Instead of seeking knowledge which will help them be more kind they end up consuming knowledge which keeps telling them to be kind.</p>

<p><strong>Build self confidence</strong><br />
Do not use knowledge as a tool to hide from your fears. Be aware of this. Stop yourself from doing this by building self confidence. Understand that fear is natural. Build self confidence by taking risks. Do things which make you scared. Slowly you will learn that fear doesn’t have to stop you from doing anything.</p>

<p><strong>Be skeptical of knowledge which is too general</strong><br />
You can’t use knowledge which is not relevant to your context. There is plenty of knowledge which is general in nature. It is taught in colleges. For example, a college can have a course on leadership. It will teach about great leaders and their characteristics. But this knowledge is not relevant to an individual student to develop leadership qualities. Useful knowledge in this context will be individual and personal. People lack leadership not because of lack of knowledge but because of lack of self confidence. Self confidence can only be developed by knowledge which deals with the personal reasons behind the lack of self confidence in a person. For example, a college can teach about how businesses handle competition. This knowledge is not useful as a strategy to handle competition will need to take into context the behaviour of actual competitors and actual environment.</p>

<p><strong>Be skeptical of knowledge derived from the past</strong><br />
You can’t use knowledge which is not relevant to your context. There is plenty of knowledge which uses historical information. It is taught in colleges. For example, a college can teach about being successful in business using examples of successful businesses in the past. This knowledge is not useful as the environment for a business changes in time.</p>

<p><strong>Be skeptical of knowledge which analysis something after-the-fact</strong><br />
For example, a college can have a course on Branding and teach about how a successful company built its brand. This knowledge analyses a brand’s success after it became successful. It will force fit a model for brand building on the success of this brand. This knowledge is not useful as it is not insightful. An insightful knowledge on brand building will provide a model for building successful brands which will work for a building new brand. Such kind of knowledge cannot be learnt from analysing successful brands as it doesn’t have access to the historical context in which numerous decisions were made which made the brand successful.</p>

<p><strong>Be skeptical of knowledge derived from statistics</strong><br />
For example, a research study can collate data on successful people and identify traits common in them. It will then proclaim that such traits increases the chances of a person being successful. But this knowledge is not insightful as it doesn’t explain how these traits made the people successful. Without that explanation this knowledge merely guesses that the traits made the person successful. Thus the knowledge is not useful to a person as there is no guarantee that inculcating these traits will make him successful.</p>
