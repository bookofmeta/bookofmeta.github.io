        <h2 id="what-is-negotiation">What is negotiation?<br /></h2>
<p>Negotiations are all pervasive in daily life. They range from mundane negotiations like negotiating with your friend to walk your dog to life changing negotiations like negotiating the sale of your business. Negotiation is a method to resolve conflict. People use negotiation to create a win-win resolution to a conflict. Parties involved in a negotiation concede a bit to get something in return.</p>

<h2 id="need-for-strategy-in-negotiation">Need for strategy in negotiation<br /></h2>
<p>A strategy for negotiating is not required with a negotiation is unselfish. If you and a friend are both unselfish you can easily resolve a conflict by conceding equally. Neither you or him will not want to take advantage of the each other. Both of you will be satisfied after conceding equally. Unfortunately more real world negotiations are not unselfish, including ones with your friends and family. People will want to concede less and take more in return. If you act selflessly in such negotiations people will take advantage of you. Thus a strategy will be useful in dealing with such negotiations.</p>

<h2 id="who-wins-a-selfish-negotiation">Who wins a selfish negotiation?<br /></h2>
<p>The person who concedes less wins a selfish negotiation. He will be able to do it only if he has more bargaining power than the other person.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-bargaining-power">What is bargaining power?<br /></h2>
<p>Bargaining power is the ability to walk away from a negotiation. You have bargaining if you have the ability to walk away from a negotiation unscathed. This is possible only when you can live without gaining anything from the negotiation. The difference in the ability to walk away among the two parties negotiating decides who has more bargaining power. For example, a company hiring a single employee from 100 applicants has more bargaining power when negotiating salary with the hire. This is because the company can easily walk away and select another applicant if the hire doesn’t accept the offer.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-best-negotiation-strategy">What is the best negotiation strategy?<br /></h2>
<p>The best strategy is to maximise your bargaining power in every negotiation.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-maximise-bargaining-power">How to maximise bargaining power?<br /></h2>
<p>You need to build bargaining power in anticipation for negotiations. You cannot build bargaining power after entering into a negotiation. For example, if you are looking to negotiate salary with your employer then get job offers from other companies before starting negotiation. This way you can walk away from the company by quitting if your employer doesn’t give you a fair salary. To be able to do this in every negotiation in your life you need to anticipate negotiation in every walk of life. It is not easy as it means that you have to constantly have backup options for everything in life. For example, to be able to negotiate with a friend you should have backup friends. A better strategy will be to be unscathed losing anything without a backup. For example, be fine walking away from a friendship and having no friends. For example, be ready to quit a job without having any other jobs offer. Be fine losing anything, your 10 year job or 15 year car 20 year marriage or 30 year son. This is not an easy strategy, but it is more achievable than having backup for everything in life. This strategy only requires you to control yourself. It requires you to be unperturbed when losing anything. It requires you to be unattached to things. To sum up, have a nothing to lose attitude in life. In essence, don’t negotiate. Just ask for you want, walk away if you don’t get it.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-negotiation-tricks">What about negotiation tricks?<br /></h2>
<p>Some negotiation tricks work by making people think that you have more bargaining power than you actually do. It will not always work. It is difficult to fake bargaining power as your desperateness will inevitably come out through your body language or verbal slip ups. It is especially difficult to do this in personal relationships as you cannot put on show for someone who spends lot of time with you. Some other negotiations tricks work by manipulating people to be happy conceding to you. This is not a good strategy as it is manipulation. People will eventually understand that you manipulated them. They will lose trust with you. You will lose respect and reputation. Exceptions are situations were a person is unreasonable or doing harm for themselves and others like in hostage situations.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-a-no-negotiation-strategy-work-in-the-long-term">How does a “no negotiation” strategy work in the long term?<br /></h2>
<p>The biggest benefit of having this strategy is that it deters people from taking advantage of you. You get fair deal without even negotiating. You will get respect. Your relationships will be better as most conflicts will be prevented even before they occur. In the long run you will lose some negotiations. But you will still be unscathed as you have a nothing to lose attitude. The net result of this strategy is that you will win more negotiations compared to having no strategy. The negotiations you lose will have no impact on you.</p>

<h2 id="does-this-strategy-make-you-selfish">Does this strategy make you selfish?<br /></h2>
<p>This strategy is not possible to implement with a selfish mindset. It takes lot of self confidence and maturity to be able to walk away from any negotiation in life. If you have such self confidence and maturity, you will be unselfish. You won’t have any reason to be selfish. Selfishness arises from attachment to things. Since you are willing to let anything go you will no longer be selfish.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-this-strategy-difficult-to-pull-it-off">Why is this strategy difficult to pull it off?<br /></h2>
<p>A nothing to lose attitude is difficult to pull off due to lack of self confidence. If you build self confidence then you will automatically have a nothing to lose attitude. Self confidence is in essence a confidence in oneself to deal with uncertainties in life.</p>

<h2 id="some-suggestions-to-get-started">Some suggestions to get started<br /></h2>
<p>Don’t give others bargaining power by getting attached to things. For example, don’t become too dependent on a friend or a job. Don’t take loans which make you dependent on a job. Don’t get too attached to your kids. Have a life of your own other than parenting. If you depend on your kids they will sense it and try to take advantage of you. Try to have backups before big negotiations in your life like negotiating salary in a new job. Then be prepared to lose some negotiations without a backup. Even if it seems scary don’t succumb to the fear. Slowly you will gain confidence in losing things.</p>

<p>Realise that it is not difficult to live without the things or people you think you need. Realize that the misgivings and uncertainties in life are not as bad as you think. Every human being has an innate resilience to overcome incredible adversities. Once you realize this then you will build self confidence and have a nothing to lose attitude.</p>
