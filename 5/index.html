        <p>Parenting when done right is a fruitful experience for you and your children. The purpose of parenting is to build strength in your children so that they can survive independently. You receive fulfilment in the process. To build strength in your children, teach them a way of life. It will paint a picture of the world in their minds so that they can handle life’s ups and downs with confidence. Teach them your way of life. You won’t be able to teach them a way of life if you don’t practice it yourself. Children are difficult to teach as they lack control over their emotions. You cannot teach them by controlling them. You have to do it through leadership. When your children accept you as their leader, they will submit to your loving leadership and follow your guidance. Their loyalty to your leadership will give them strength to follow your guidance despite temptations to wander. For your children to accept you as a leader you have to be strong. You have to be strong enough to love them unconditionally. You have to be strong enough to not depend on them for your own well-being. You have to be strong enough to remain stoic when they try to manipulate you using emotional drama. They will hate you for not giving in to their manipulations. But they will respect you for being a rock. Their rock.</p>
