        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction<br /></h2>
<p>Parenting is tough. It gives modern parents some joy and plenty of suffering. Much of the suffering can be removed by understanding how parenting works. Clarity in how parenting works will reduce the unknowns and give confidence to you as a parent. It will help you handle tough situations with confidence. This article offers an explanation of how parenting works. It also offers some advice on how to be an effective parent.</p>

<h2 id="objective-of-parenting">Objective of parenting<br /></h2>
<p>The objective of parenting is too raise children to be independent adults. An independent adult will be able to live happily on their own. They are mentally strong. They have abundance of self confidence. They handle uncertainties and adversities of life with grace.</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-people-mental-strong">What makes people mental strong?<br /></h2>
<p>Mentally strong people know that the world is uncertain. They also know that their reaction to this uncertainty can be controlled. They control their reaction by controlling their emotions. So in order to be happy in an uncertain world they learn to control their emotional reactions to the world rather than trying to change the world. For example, when someone insults them they learn to not get angry rather than trying to make another person change their behaviour. This self control gives them confidence to tackle unseen adversities in life. It helps them be calm under pressure.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-characteristics-of-mentally-strong-people">What are the characteristics of mentally strong people?<br /></h2>
<p>They live their lives based on moral principles. Some follow principles set by their region, some set their own. Their faith in moral principles give them strength to control their emotions. Their faith in their principles is reinforced when they see it help them be happy.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-raise-children-to-be-mentally-strong">How to raise children to be mentally strong?<br /></h2>
<p>Teach them moral principles. If you are religious teach them your religion. If you have your own principles teach them that.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-teach-principles-to-children">How to teach principles to children?<br /></h2>
<p>Teaching anything to children is hard as they look for instant gratification. Teaching principles is difficult as they give benefit only in the long run. They cannot be taught to children through reason as reason will not be able to overcome the instant gratification mindset of children. The principles themselves will seem risky for a child. The child takes a risk whenever he tries to live by a principle. This happens due to natural insecurity in a child. For example, when you tell your child to not fear a bully, it is a risky ploy for the child. So the child will be naturally averse to accepting principles. The only way to teach principles to children is to influence them to adhere to it. Once they see the benefits they will accept it on their own. This is possible only if the parent has influence on the child.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-influence-children">How to influence children?<br /></h2>
<p>One method to influence children is fear. Teaching with fear is teaching without a safety net. This is because the child will see the parent as an authority and fear failing. The risks taken by a child is magnified by the lack of safety net. So it becomes more and more difficult for the child to take risks as he grow as he didn’t gain confidence by successfully taking risks when he was young. So the child reaches adulthood with little or no principles. They will face the world without self confidence. They grow up to be mentally weak.</p>

<p>Another method to influence children is to use rewards. This method is popular among modern parents. Parents try to bribe they children to make them behave according to principles. But this method is not effective as children are given an option to decline the reward. As children see principles as risky they will choose to decline reward. They will progressively decline higher rewards as their aversion for principles increase the more they reject it. A child who grows up like this will grow up with little or no principles. They will face the world without self confidence. They grow up to be mentally weak.</p>

<p>The best method to influence children is through parental leadership. Leadership will have strong influence on children. Parents who are leaders of their children will be able to influence their children to behave according to principles in spite of the children feeling aversion towards. Their influence works less through fear and more through trust and loyalty. Leadership will give strength to children to take risks in behaving according to principles. Leadership will build self confidence in the child as it provides a safety net of empathy when the child fails.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-leadership">What is leadership?<br /></h2>
<p>Leadership is the taking care of weak by the strong. A leader is empathetic for his followers and cares for them sacrificially. The sacrificial nature of care makes followers submit to the leader. Once followers submit to a leader they cede their autonomy to the leader to follow their guidance. The weak feel strong following a leader. They are able to take big risks when they have the backing of a leader. For example, a general of an army is strong enough to make this followers submit to his leadership. His followers feel so strong after following him that they don’t hesitate to put their lives at risk on his command.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-parental-leadership-look-like">What does parental leadership look like?<br /></h2>
<p>It is an unequal relationship. A parent shouldn’t treat a child as an equal. He shouldn’t take his child’s demands, tantrums and views seriously. The parent should always have the upper hand in the relationship. A parent should demonstrate the unequal nature of relationship to the child so that the child feels safe to be with a strong parent. Children should respect their parents not out of fear, but out of devotion and loyalty. Parents should be completely selfless towards their children. They shouldn’t expect anything in return. They should derive joy by sacrificially caring for their child. Parents should not be afraid to take tough decisions which children don’t like. Children should be able to trust parents’ decisions for them even if they don’t like it. Parents should never get manipulated by children.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-become-your-child-leader">How to become your child leader?<br /></h2>
<p>Your child will not accept you as his leader just because you are his parent. You need to show leadership qualities. Once you do that your child will automatically accept you as his leader.</p>

<h2 id="leadership-qualities">Leadership qualities<br /></h2>
<p>Mental strength is the essential quality of a leader.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-become-your-childs-leader">How to become your child’s leader?<br /></h2>
<p>You don’t have to be the world’s most mentally strong person to become your child’s leader. You just have to be more mentally strong that your child. Even if you are not naturally mentally strong you can act strong in your child’s eye to get their respect. Following are natural behaviours of mentally strong people which you can mimic:</p>

<p><strong>Pass leadership tests</strong><br />
Your child will naturally look for a leader in you. The way he finds out if you are a leader is by testing you. If you pass his tests he will start respecting you. Soon he will accept you as his leader. Your child will test you subconsciously. All his tests will try to manipulate you. They will try to elicit some sort of emotional response from you. If you remain manipulated you win the test. For example, he will deliberately disobey you. If you respond with anger you lose the test. He will get joy from making you angry. If you respond with calm disappointment you will gain his respect. For example, he will try to manipulate you by throwing tantrums. He will act as if he will die without a candy. If you give in and buy him the candy he will lose respect for you. But you remain calm and completely ignore his tantrum, he will gain respect for you after he calms down. He might throw a bigger tantrum when you ignore him, but eventually he will calm down and have new found respect for you. You child should find it impossible to manipulate. Passing leadership tests is in essence taming your child. See every case of child disobeying you or disrespecting you as an opportunity to show your leadership. Unfortunately your child will never stop testing you. But the tests will decrease the more you demonstrate your mental strength.</p>

<p><strong>Be selfless</strong><br />
You should demonstrate unlimited empathy for your child. Most people who show empathy for others only have shallow empathy. They empathy dies as soon as they find it uncomfortable. They are fair weather friends. But mentally strong people have empathy for others even when it hurts them. The ability to withstand emotional trauma helps them care for others when under stress. For example, a good corporate manager will shield his team from pressure from higher management so that they can work without stress. The manager will bear all the pressure of higher management out of empathy for his team. As a parent you should demonstrate similar selflessness for your child. You should invest your time, effort and resources in your child without expecting anything in return. You shouldn’t use your child to increase your status in society. You shouldn’t put pressure on them to be successful so that you can brag about them with your friends. You shouldn’t push your child to a career path because you couldn’t do it yourself. You shouldn’t even care if your child has gratitude for your sacrifices. There should be nothing to gain for you from you child. Your child will sense your selflessness and respect you for that.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t be yourself around your children</strong><br />
Children are natural insecure because they are intimated by the world. Due to this insecurity they don’t respond well to weakness in adults. They disrespect adults who are weak. Since you are your child’s leader you cannot afford to lose respect in his eyes. So you should never show your weakness to him. You will naturally have weak moments like any other adult. But you should hide it from your child. You cannot be vulnerable in front of your children. You should not share your insecurities or problems with them. Unfortunately that means you cannot be yourself around your children. You need to put on a show for their sake.</p>

<p><strong>Be a rock, their rock</strong><br />
Remember this phrase. It carries the essence of parental leadership. You should display mental strength so that your child sees you as a rock. You should display selflessness so that your child sees you as his rock.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-influence-your-child-once-you-become-his-leader">How to influence your child once you become his leader<br /></h2>
<p>Teach him your principles through life experiences. Expose him to the world so that he can use principles in the real world. Let him fail to succeed. This will build self confidence in him. Expose the world to them gently. Once he builds confidence then expose more of the world. Provide a safety net by not judging him when he fails. Help him take risks by having confidence in them. Build a strong bond of trust so that he knows that you are always on his side, even when he fails. When your child is young he will follow your guidance because you are his leader. As he ages he will gain self confidence and slowly become independent. But he will still follow you as he will not want to disappoint you. His gratitude and respect for you will make him not want to disappoint you. As he reaches adulthood you should stop using your influence so that he can become completely independent. Eventually he will become completely independent. You will lose your influence. Your relationship will change from a leader to a friend he respects.</p>

<h2 id="handling-difficulties-in-being-your-childs-leader">Handling difficulties in being your child’s leader<br /><br /></h2>

<p><strong>Self confidence</strong><br />
The main problem most parents will face is their lack of mental strength. It is not difficult if you push yourself. You will naturally gain will power after becoming a parent. Use that will power to push yourself to take risks and be comfortable with stress. Push yourself to remain calm under pressure. You will naturally gaining confidence once you see success.</p>

<p><strong>Use support groups</strong><br />
You can gain strength using parent support groups. You can use it as a place to be vulnerable. You can share your difficulties in parenting with other parents. It will make you feel that you are not alone in this endeavour. That will itself make you stronger.</p>

<p><strong>Have a life separate from parenting</strong><br />
Many parents get too involved in parenting. This itself makes them weak as they attach too much importance to success in parenting. This makes them take minor set backs personally. They lose confidence leading to more setbacks leading to a vicious cycle of loss in confidence. This can be prevented by having a productive life outside parenting. For example, having a fulfilling career or some other mission. Something other than parenting has to be your No.1 mission in life. Your children will respect you just on this. Success outside parenting will help you handle the ups and downs of parenting with grace.</p>
