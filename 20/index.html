        <p>It is not wise to be yourself around <a href="/18/">selfish</a> people. Selfish people will not accept you for yourself. Selfish people are <a href="/17/">weak</a>. They put their needs first as they are insecure. They can’t empathize with needs of others. If you display weakness they will be happy as it makes them feel superior. They will project their insecurity onto you. If you treat them with respect they will disrespect you as they don’t respect themselves. If you are always available to them they will not value you as they don’t value themselves. If you are eager to help them they will exploit you as they don’t believe in relationship equity. If you display vulnerability they will label you as weak as they see vulnerability as weakness. If you are willing to negotiate they will exploit you as they don’t believe in giving back. They adopt herd opinions. If others like you, they like you. If others don’t respect you, they don’t respect you. They can’t see another person’s perspective. If you depend on them they will resent you for putting pressure on them. You shouldn’t be yourself especially around people who depend on you. Seeing you vulnerable and weak will frighten them. It will make them weak. You have to put on a facade of unreal strength for them to feel secure. A parent has to do this for their child. A family head has to do this for their family.</p>
