        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction<br /></h2>
<p>Listening seems to be a complicated skill. People don’t understand why someone called them a bad listener. They took part in the conversation and heard whatever the other person said. But still they are accused of not listening. This confusion happens because listening is more than just hearing what is being said.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-bad-listening">What is bad listening?<br /></h2>

<p>Conversation is sharing of point of views. When two people talk they are sharing their point of views to each other. Each of them need two skills to do this successfully. They both need to know how to communicate and how to listen. Communication is the ability to explain your point of view. Listening is your ability to understand someone’s point of view. Bad listening is failure in understanding someone’s point of view.</p>

<h2 id="characteristics-of-bad-listening">Characteristics of bad listening<br /></h2>

<p>People fail to understand in two ways. One way is by interrupting communication. The other way is by refusing to understand.</p>

<h2 id="interruption">Interruption<br /><br /></h2>

<p><strong>Interrupting to correct</strong><br />
In this case people interrupt to correct a trivial mistakes.</p>

<p>It could be correct an erroneous fact. <br />
Example:<br />
John: I was amazed by the solar eclipses of 2017. It was a September, I was travelling on work when I saw the eclipse in the middle of the road, it was…(interrupted by Adam)<br />
Adam: The eclipse was in August not September!<br />
The month of the eclipse is irrelevant to the conversation as John is trying to communicate his experience of watching the eclipse. Adam is a bad listener for interrupting John’s communication.</p>

<p>It could be correct mistake in language.<br />
Example:<br />
John: Now that I am single, I don’t know with who I will go the school dance. I am so sad, sometimes I feel… (interrupted by Adam)<br />
Adam: It is not who but whom. I don’t know with whom I will go.<br />
Grammar is irrelevant to the conversation as Adam understood the meaning of what John said. Adam is a bad listener for interrupting John’s communication of feelings.</p>

<p><strong>Interrupting to share your experience</strong><br />
In this case you interrupt to share your experience even though they are irrelevant.<br />
Example:<br />
John: I have been feeling depressed since I broke up with Tracy. I am not able to study or even… (interrupted by Adam)<br />
Adam: My friend David was also depressed when he broke up with his girlfriend.<br />
David’s experience is irrelevant to the conversation. John is trying to explain his despair in hopes of getting empathy from Adam. Adam is a bad listener for interrupting it.</p>

<p><strong>Trying to impress</strong><br />
It could be to impress with knowledge.<br />
Example:<br />
John: I went to the Grand Canyon with my Family. When my brother try to take I selfie he dropped his iPhone and the screen cracked. Dad immediately …(interrupted by Adam)<br />
Adam: Did you that the Grand Canyon is more than a mile deep?<br />
The depth of Grand Canyon is irrelevant to the conversation. Adam is a bad listener for interrupting John’s communication of an event.</p>

<p>It could be to impress with jokes<br />
Example:<br />
John: I visited by cousin in hospital. His legs had swollen due to the infection. His toes were huge.<br />
Adam: That’s what she said!<br />
The joke made by Adam made light of a serious situation. Adam is a bad listener by interrupting John’s sharing of a somber situation.</p>

<p><strong>Giving unsolicited advice</strong><br />
Example:<br />
John: I have been feeling depressed since I broke up with Tracy. I am not able to study or even… (interrupted by Adam)<br />
Adam: Get a new girlfriend John!<br />
Adam’s solution is irrelevant as John is not looking for a solution. His is depressed and is looking for empathy. Adam is a bad listener for interrupting John’s communication of feelings.</p>

<h2 id="refusing-to-understand">Refusing to understand<br /></h2>
<p>In this case people refuse to understand another person’s point of view.</p>

<p><strong>They could do it by trivialising a point of view</strong><br />
Example:<br />
John: I have been feeling depressed since I broke up with Tracy. I am not able to study or even… (interrupted by Adam)<br />
Adam: Get over it man! Everyone goes through a breakup or two.<br />
Adam is trivialising John’s feelings. He is a bad listener refusing to understand John’s feelings.</p>

<p><strong>They could do it by debating a point of view</strong><br />
Example:<br />
John: John: I have been feeling depressed since I broke up with Tracy. I am not able to study or even… (interrupted by Adam)<br />
Adam: Tracy should be the one feeling depressed, not you. You didn’t treat her well.<br />
Adam asserts that John has no reason to feel depressed. It is bad listening as John is trying to communicate his feelings and Adam is refusing to acknowledge it. Even if Adam is right about John treating Tracy badly, this conversation is not the right conversation to bring it up. The purpose of the conversation is for John to communicate his feelings. It is not to find out who is at fault for John’s breakup.</p>

<h2 id="why-people-interrupt">Why people interrupt?<br /></h2>
<p>People interrupt because they don’t see understanding as the purpose of conversation. They see approval seeking as the purpose of conversation. Approval seeking is the behaviour in which people look for approval from others for their self respect. Their self respect depends on others giving approval that they are worthy of respect. This approval can be in the form of respect, compliments or perceived superiority. Their self respect increases when they get compliments from others and decreases when they get disrespect. People with such behavior have low self respect. Because they do not have sufficient respect for themselves they see external evidence for respecting themselves. They use every interaction with others as an evidence gathering exercise for self respect. It affects their listening ability. They interrupt others during conversations to seek approval. They seek approval by trying to demonstrate that they are superior than the person they are talking to. They think that by doing this the other person will give them respect. They correct facts and mistakes in language to show superiority in knowledge. They give unsolicited advice to show superiority in wisdom. They try to impress with jokes and knowledge to show superiority in intellect. Ironically, they lose respect due to this behaviour as it seems immature to others.</p>

<h2 id="why-people-refuse-to-understand">Why people refuse to understand?<br /></h2>
<p>People refuse to understand because they don’t see understanding as the purpose of conversation. They see approval seeking as the purpose of conversation. They trivialise a person’s point of view because it makes them feel superior. They think that treating serious issues as trivial makes them seem experienced and strong, thus superior. They debate a person’s point of view to prove it wrong. They feel superior when they prove others wrong. They think it shows intellectual superiority. Ironically, they lose respect due to this behavior as it seems immature to others.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-become-a-good-listener">How to become a good listener?<br /></h2>
<p>Do not use conversations to seek approval. Do not seek approval from others. Build self respect. When you have self respect you will automatically stop seeking approval from others. You will automatically stop using conversations for seek approval.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-stop-approval-seeking-behaviour">How to stop approval seeking behaviour?<br /></h2>
<p>Understand that it is a lost cause trying to get approval from others. It is very difficult as you will always find people who will not give you approval. They will not give you approval no matter how much effort you put in. This is because they themselves lack self respect. They lose their self respect when they give approval to others. This is because they have an insatiable thirst for approval. This thirst makes them lose self respect when they see others get approval as they think that there is a limited supply approval for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-not-seek-approval-in-a-conversation">How to not seek approval in a conversation?<br /></h2>
<p>You need to suspend your point of view in order to understand another point of view. Don’t correct factual mistakes or errors in delivery. It is not your responsibility to correct errors in knowledge of others. Never try to prove a point of view as wrong. Understand that people have different perspectives. It is fine when others have a point of view different from yours. In essence, don’t judge others when they talk. You will notice that people will pick up on your lack of judgement and talk more to you as it is rare to find a person who doesn’t judge others. Think of listening as being compassionate to someone. People receive kindness in the form of empathy when you understand their point of view. That by itself will bring happiness to the person. Give them that gift.</p>
