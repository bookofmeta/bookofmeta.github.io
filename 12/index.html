        <p>The objective of conversation is for two people to understand each other’s point of views. Listening is your ability to understand a person’s point of view. You become a bad listener when you refuse to understand a point of view or impede communication of it. Both happens when you have a difference objective for conversing - validation of your self-worth. You use conversations as a tool to feel good about yourself. You use conversations to display your superiority or find weakness in others. Instead of understanding a point of view you evaluate it for weakness. When you find trivial mistakes you interrupt the conversation to point it out. When you detect a problem you rush to provide a solution. When you find a point of view conflicting with your point of view you refuse to understand it and convert the conversation into an argument to prove the other person wrong. To become a good listener stop using conversations for validation for your self-worth. Treat them only as a tool to understand a person’s point of view. Remember that understanding is a gift of kindness you give to a person. It is selfless. You have to suspend your point of view to understand another person’s point of you. Don’t evaluate or try to correct another person’s point of view. You have no responsibility for it. Offer your point of view only if there is interest for it.</p>
