        <p>There are diverse views of things which are unseen. Some people think rain is created by a god while others think it is precipitation of condensed water vapor. When they discuss their different views they are never able to reach a consensus. They are disturbed by the reluctance of the other to see the obvious. But they have more in common than they think. They agree on what they can see. They agree that it is raining when they see rain. They agree in the faculty of reason. They agree that rain doesn’t happen randomly and there has to be a reason behind it. But they can’t agree on the unseen reason for rain. Their views are different because they are derived from different dogmas. A religious person assumes the existence of god as a dogma. A scientist assumes the uniformity of the universe as a dogma. Dogmas are unseen phenomena which are accepted as seen. They are accepted without reason. They are accepted in a leap of faith. Dogmas allow explanation of the unseen in terms what is seen. They are the foundations on which views of the unseen reality are built. Two people with different dogmas cannot reconcile their views of the unseen as they see two different realities.</p>
