        <p>Mental strength is the ability to handle emotions. It is ability to not lose control of yourself despite emotions. It is the ability to not let emotions drive your behaviour. When you are mentally strong you are not overwhelmed by joy and misery. You don’t crack under pressure. You prioritize long term happiness over short term happiness as you can postpone gratification. You feel secure about yourself as you are able to see the impermanence of ups and downs in life. You don’t take misfortunes personally as they are just emotions. You are not preoccupied by fear of death as fear is just another emotion. You have a sense of morality, honour and justice as you don’t let emotions affect your rationality. You are selfless as you have no reason to be selfish. You have control over the direction of your life. When you are mentally weak, you let emotions overpower you. They drive your behaviour. You are overwhelmed by joy and misery. You crack under pressure. You prioritize short term happiness over long term happiness as you can’t postpone gratification. You feel insecure about yourself as you take misfortunes personally. Your insecurity makes you look for <a href="/6/">validation</a> from society. You don’t have a sense of morality, honour or justice as emotions affect your rationality. You are <a href="/18/">selfish</a> because you see other people as tools to handle your insecurity. You have no control over direction of your life.</p>
