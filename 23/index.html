        <p>Leaders and bullies influence people. Both get their influence through submission. People give up their autonomy and behave according to the will of leaders and bullies. But people’s submission is different in leadership and bullying. In <a href="/4/">leadership</a> submission is voluntary, whereas in bullying, it is coerced. In leadership, people trust a leader and follow their guidance. In bullying people submit out of fear. A leader earns their influence, a bully forces it. A leader gets loyalty, a bully gets distrust. A leader earns respect, a bully demands respect. Following a leader makes people strong, following a bully makes people weak. People will fight battles for a leader but never for a bully. People will discipline themselves for a leader but never for a bully. A leader doesn’t care about influence, a bully is obsessed about influence. Leaders inspire, bullies intimidate. Leaders are selfless, bullies are selfish. Leaders are <a href="/17/">strong</a>, bullies are weak.</p>
