        <p>Manipulation is when someone influences your behaviour for their benefit. Manipulators are selfish. They parasitically use other people for their benefit. They do not care about the well-being of people they manipulate. They depend on the manipulation of others for their well-being. It makes them weak. You shouldn’t let others manipulate you as they will make you act against your self interest. You shouldn’t let it happen even out of compassion for the manipulator as your energy is better spent on yourself or others who need it. You will be doing a favour to the manipulator by resisting their manipulation. You are giving them an opportunity to not depend on others for their well-being. To prevent manipulation you have to differentiate manipulation from legitimate requests. If someone tries to influence your behaviour for selfish reasons, it is manipulation. A manipulator will use a weakness in you as leverage. This weakness can be anything you are attached to, like safety, property, love or reputation. When a manipulator has the ability to harm your weakness they have leverage. They will use threat of harm to coerce you. Even your loved ones can manipulate you. If you are dependent on their love they can threaten to withdraw it to manipulate you. To prevent manipulation don’t be attached to anything that can be taken away from you. Have nothing to lose. When you have nothing to lose manipulators have no leverage on you. They can’t manipulate you. Instead they respect you.</p>
