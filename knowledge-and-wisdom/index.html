        <h2 id="what-is-knowledge">What is knowledge?<br /></h2>
<p>Knowledge is the understanding you have about yourself and the world.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-wisdom">What is wisdom?<br /></h2>
<p>Wisdom is knowledge gained through experience. You need to be self-aware to gain knowledge through experience. Such knowledge will help you understand yourself and others.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-self-awareness">What is self-awareness?<br /></h2>
<p>Self-awareness is the ability to see yourself objectively. For example, when you are angry you will be able to see yourself as being angry. When you are sad you will be able to see yourself being sad. When you are lying to someone you will be able to see that you are lying. All people have this awareness. All people are self-aware at some points in life. But when they are in emotional turmoil they lose their self-awareness. Very few people have the ability to be self-aware even under emotional turmoil. For example, when you are angry you allow yourself to be mean to people who have nothing to do with your anger. If you were self-aware you would be able to stop yourself from doing it. You lose your self-awareness when you get carried away by emotions.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-people-have-awareness">What kind of people have awareness?<br /></h2>
<p>People who are self-aware are confident. Their confidence allows them to maintain the balance of their mind in spite of emotional turmoil. They do it without conscious thought. People who are not self-aware are not confident. This makes them easily lose the balance of their mind when under emotional turmoil.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-gain-wisdom-from-experience">How do you gain wisdom from experience?<br /></h2>
<p>You gain wisdom by not rejecting knowledge which makes you uncomfortable. Both self-aware and self-unaware people encounter useful knowledge from their experience. Self-unaware people reject knowledge which makes them feel uncomfortable. Self-aware people accept it even though it makes them feel uncomfortable. It becomes their wisdom. So self-aware people gain wisdom by accepting knowledge which others reject. For example, you could realize one day that you are not compatible with your spouse. You see that the incompatibility is creating problems in your relationship. This knowledge will make you uncomfortable. If you are self-aware, you will accept the knowledge in spite of it being uncomfortable. If you are not self-aware, you will reject the knowledge because it makes you uncomfortable.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-self-unaware-people-reject-knowledge-which-makes-them-uncomfortable">How do self-unaware people reject knowledge which makes them uncomfortable?<br /></h2>
<p>First, you try to ignore the uncomfortable knowledge. If ignoring the knowledge is not possible, you use a thought process called rationalisation to reject it. Rationalisation is a thought process in which you use reason to justify a preconceived opinion. In a normal opinion-making process, you use reason to arrive at an opinion. In rationalization, you arrive at an opinion first and reason it afterwards. For example, you might realize that your spouse is incompatible with you after having numerous disagreements. This knowledge will make you uncomfortable as the only solution for incompatibility is to end your marriage, which seems too scary for you. So you will experience the emotions of fear and shame. So you look for a way to come out of the situation without taking any action. So you decide to invalidate the knowledge. You come up with an opinion which will invalidate the knowledge that you and your spouse and not compatible. Then you use reason to justify this opinion. For example, You tell yourself that disagreements with your spouse don’t mean that you are incompatible. You tell yourself that the disagreements are isolated incidents and not part of a larger pattern. You blame external factors like your spouse’s stress in their job as the reason behind those disagreements. You blame yourself for disagreeing unnecessarily with your spouse. Once you are able to convince yourself with this opinion, it invalidates your original realization of incompatibility with your spouse. You will no longer feel fear or shame. You successfully convinced yourself that your situation with your spouse is normal. But in reality, it is not. Your marriage will continue to have disagreements. In an attempt to avoid uncomfortable emotions you rejected wisdom about your marriage. If you were self-aware you would have accepted the wisdom in spite of it making you uncomfortable.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-wisdom-helpful">How is wisdom helpful?<br /><br /></h2>

<p><strong>Wisdom will help you gain knowledge about yourself</strong><br />
Wisdom will help you learn about yourself. You will learn about the emotions which drive your behaviour. You will learn how your own behaviour sabotages your well being. You will learn about the subtle reasons behind your everyday actions. For example, if you like to go to parties you will learn the subtle reasons behind it. You might realize that you go to parties not for joy, but for the idea of going parties. You will realize that you like the idea of going to a party because it helps you maintain a status in your peer group. Then you will realise that trying to maintain a status in your peer group is very difficult. You will realize that this endeavour gives you more suffering than joy. So you will stop yourself from doing it. If you are not self-aware you will miss such wisdom. You will have no knowledge about why you like going to parties. You will waste tremendous energy by continuing to go to parties even though they don’t give you joy in the long run.</p>

<p><strong>Wisdom will help you gain knowledge about others</strong><br />
When you are not self-aware you see the behaviour of other people through rationalisation. For example, when a person shows anger you label them as mean. This is because their anger makes you uncomfortable. But when you are self-aware you can see the real reasons behind the behaviour of others. You will realize that the behaviour of others are driven by same emotions that drive you. You will understand that everyone becomes angry when they are frustrated. It doesn’t mean that they are mean. You will relate to it by your own experience of being angry out of frustration. So being self-aware will give you knowledge about others. It will help you have a happier relationship with people. You will also be able to resolve conflicts by seeing the underlying reasons for conflicts. For example, if you learn through wisdom that most of the conflicts with your spouse happen because she doesn’t like you being submissive, then you can resolve such conflicts by developing leadership skills.</p>
