        <h2 id="what-is-knowledge">What is knowledge?<br /></h2>
<p>Knowledge is understanding about self and the world.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-wisdom">What is wisdom?<br /></h2>
<p>Wisdom is knowledge gained through experience. It helps people in their well being.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-people-get-wisdom">How do people get wisdom?<br /></h2>
<p>People get wisdom through their life experience. Some people gain wisdom from experience and others don’t. People who gain wisdom are self aware. They have the ability to observe themselves objectively. Because of this ability they can learn from their experience. They learn how they interact and react to the world. They are able to learn from their mistakes. With this learning they are able to control their well being. They are able to control the journey of their life. They have wisdom. People who are not self aware are not able to learn from their experiences. They are not able to learn from their mistakes. They don’t have control over their well being. To them their life always seem unpredictable. They don’t have wisdom.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-awareness">What is awareness?<br /></h2>
<p>Self awareness is the ability to see yourself without bias. For example, when you are angry you will be able to see yourself as being angry. When you are sad you will be able to see yourself being sad. When you are lying to someone you will be able to see that you are lying. All people have this awareness. All people are self aware at some points in life. But when they are in emotional turmoil they lose their self awareness. Very few people have the ability to be self aware even under emotional turmoil. For example, when you are angry you allow yourself to be mean to people who have nothing to do with your anger. If you were self aware you would be able to stop yourself from doing it. People lose their awareness by getting carried away by emotions. This is why they commit mistakes which they later regret. If they maintain their awareness they can stop themselves from making mistakes.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-people-have-awareness">What kind of people have awareness?<br /></h2>
<p>People who are self aware are confident. They do not get carried away by negative or positive emotions. They maintain the balance of their mind in spite of emotional turmoil. People who are not self aware not confident. They are insecure. They easily lose the balance of their mind when under emotional turmoil. They get carried away by both positive and negative emotions.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-self-aware-people-learn-from-experience">How do self aware people learn from experience?<br /></h2>
<p>When they learn something about themselves or the world from experience they accept it. They own up to it even if it creates an emotional turmoil. For example, you could realize one day that you are not compatible with your spouse. You see that the incompatibility is creating problems in your relationship. This realization will make you uncomfortable. This is an uncomfortable realisation for any person. It will create emotional turmoil in form of fear and shame. A person who is self aware will accept the realisation in spite of the emotions. A person who is not self aware will reject this realisation to avoid the emotions.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-non-self-aware-people-not-learn-from-experience">How do non-self aware people not learn from experience?<br /></h2>
<p>First they try to ignore the realization as it makes them feel uncomfortable. If that becomes difficult they use rationalisation to come out it. Rationalisation is a thought process which you use to reason an opinion. In a normal opinion making process, you use reason to arrive at an opinion. In rationalization, you arrive at an opinion first and reason it after-the-fact. For example, when you realize that your spouse is not compatible with you, it will make you uncomfortable. You might have realized this after having several disagreements with your spouse. The realization will make you uncomfortable. This is because you know that the next logical step is to end the marriage. But that seems too scary for you to do. So you are stuck with uncomfortable emotions of fear snd shame as you are not able to solve the situation. The only way out for you is to challenge the reality of the situation itself. You tell yourself that the realization that you have to break the marriage to solve the situation is false. Then you proceed to convince yourself with this theory using evidence. You tell yourself that all marriages are like yours. No one has a perfectly compatible spouse. You gather evidence for it. You don’t care if the evidence is flimsy. For example, you take example of a fictional tv couple for remaining in marriage in spite of incompatibility as good enough evidence. You ignore contrary evidence. If your brother separated from his wife because of incompatibility you tell yourself that the real reason is the ego of both the spouses. If you find it difficult to convince yourself of this theory then you create a new theory. For example, you could have a new theory that the disagreements you had with your spouse doesn’t mean that you are incompatible. You could tell yourself that the disagreements are isolated incidents and not part of a larger pattern. You could blame external factors like your spouse’s stress in job as the reason behind those disagreements. You could also blame yourself for the disagreements. You find out a way to reason and convince yourself that your situation is normal. It gives you immediate relief from fear and shame. But it doesn’t solve the problem in your marriage. Your marriage will continue to have disagreements.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-wisdom-helpful">How is wisdom helpful?<br /><br /></h2>

<p><strong>It will help you be more happy by learning about yourself</strong><br />
It will help you learn about yourself. You will learn the emotions which drive your behaviour. Your will learn how your own behaviour sabotages your well being. You will be happier. For example you will realize that you go to a party for not joy, but for the idea of going party. You will then realize that you like the idea of going to a party because you need a status among your peer group. Then you will realise that trying to maintain a status in your peer group is very difficult. You realize that this endeavour gives you more suffering than joy. So you stop yourself from doing it. You are able to stop yourself because you are able to maintain your awareness even under emotional turmoil. People who lack self awareness cannot stop themselves from doing a mistake even when if they know it is a mistake. This is because they lose their awareness by getting carried way by emotions.</p>

<p><strong>It will help you be more happy by learning about others</strong><br />
When you not self aware you see behaviour of other people through rationalisation. For example, when a person shows anger for due to frustration you label them as a mean person. This is because you are uncomfortable blaming yourself for their frustration. But when you are self aware you can see behaviour of others objectively. You will also realize that behaviours of others are driven by same emotions that drive you. You can understand and predict behaviour of others by putting yourself in their shoes. For example, you will learn that people act mean out of frustration. You will understand that everyone becomes angry when they are frustrated. It doesn’t mean that they are a mean person. You will relate it by your own experience of being angry out of frustration. You will gain wisdom about others. It will help you have happier relationship with people. You will also be able to resolve conflicts by seeing the underlying reasons for the conflict. You will be able to prevent conflicts with the knowledge of emotions which drive people to conflict. For example, if you learn through wisdom that most of the conflicts with your spouse happens because she doesn’t like you being submissive in the relationship, then you can prevent conflicts by actively taking a leadership role in the relationship. This is not manipulative behaviour. You cannot gain wisdom with a selfish motive. This is because you will lose self awareness as soon as you become selfish. Being selfish makes you lose touch with reality, you will get intro rationalisation. You no longer get wisdom from experiences.</p>

<h2 id="wisdom-and-morality">Wisdom and morality<br /></h2>
<p>Having wisdom about the emotions which drive your behaviour will make you develop rules by which you live by. These rules will help you stop yourself from behaviour which bring your suffering. You will also teach these rules to others as you also understand how emotions drive behaviour of others. These rules form your morality.</p>
