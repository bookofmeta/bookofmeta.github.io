        <p>We experience reality through perception. It is constrained by limitation of the senses. For example eyes can see only light of certain wavelengths. But all of perception is guesswork. It is a creation of the mind. The mind uses input from senses to create an image of reality. There is no guarantee that it is an exact representation of reality as there is no way to validate it. We also experience unseen reality which is out of reach of the senses. For example, We experience the atom and we experience god’s will. We experience the unseen using a combination of perception and reason. Scientists experience the atom through experiments. They use perception to observe results of experiments. Then, they use reason to convert these results to an image of the atom. Religious people experience god’s will through experiences in their lives. They use perception to experience life. Then they use reason to convert these experiences to an image of god’s will. Science and religion are systems of reason which help in experiencing the unseen by means of perception. They are built on <a href="/3/">dogmatic assumptions</a> about the relation between the unseen and perception. These assumptions link the unseen and perception. Scientists assume that the universe is uniform. Religious people assume the existence of god. All experience of the unseen is guesswork. They are creations of dogmatic assumptions. There is no guarantee that these assumptions are true as there is no way to validate them.</p>
